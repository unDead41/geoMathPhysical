# Changelog

## 2026-10-24 - Clean architecture

- Extracted a hardware-independent quiz engine, rules, persisted types and UID
  validation; state is owned by modules and exposed through const snapshots.
- Injected clock, randomness, logging, registry storage and reader control through
  application ports. RFID/buttons dispatch input events wired in setup.
- Split pure LCD frame rendering from the I2C driver and moved Preferences into
  its own adapter. Board config now contains electrical settings only.
- Kept one firmware source and existing tabs/PlatformIO entry; each module also
  compiles independently to detect hidden include-order dependencies.
- Added hardware-free core/application/view tests and regressions for storage
  failures, duplicate UID, serial overflow, pause/resume and legacy NVS bytes.
- Documented architecture boundaries and corrected RGB environment guidance.

The existing question text, GPIO map, quiz flow and persisted UID ABI are
preserved; both ordinary LED and RGB firmware environments are supported.

## 2026-10-24 - Initial GitHub import and VS Code support

- Imported the supplied `Geo-Decoder Board.zip`, including original firmware,
  LCD previews, printable cards, documentation and simulation tests.
- Added a PlatformIO entry point that uses the original `.ino` modules.
- Added pinned ESP32 platform and library versions, ordinary-LED/RGB build
  environments, VS Code extension recommendations and per-computer COM settings.
- Added a Malay guide for clone, Build, Upload, Monitor, card enrolment and
  physical play directly in VS Code.
- Added an option to run the existing simulation suite through `src/main.cpp`.
- Corrected outdated command documentation: the bank has 15 questions and
  NEXT on the menu starts a fresh round.

GPIO assignments, question content, quiz behaviour and persisted UID format
remain those of the supplied firmware.
